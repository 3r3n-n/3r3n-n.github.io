As part of the reset phase of Encora Academy, we read the book ***Make it stick: The Science of Successful Learning***, published in 2014 and written by Peter C. Brown. This book provides an evidence-based analysis and approach to the learning (and teaching) process.

The first part is also like a reset chapter, because it challenges popular preconceptions about education and learning that are actually just myths. The author provides evidence to make the case for this. The most significative myth that I encountered in this chapter was the belief that repetitive exposure builds memory. Repetition by itself does not guarantee any retention. One can re-read, re-watch or re-listen certain content a ton of times; however, this is a very passive process and we need our brains to be more participative, to say the least, for the knowledge to be actually ingrained in them. In a bit, we will see more concretely how we can make that happen.

In the next part, the author introduces what I think is the key learning tool that this book proposes: retrieval. In its most basic form, it is about trying to remember things that were previously learned (given that at least a bit of time has passed since then) without any sort of help. This is the reason why tests are actually useful for retention and maybe this is the controversial point of this book, which I think that should not be, because, as the author writes, "pitting the learning of basic knowledge against the development of creative thinking is a false choice. Both need to be cultivated". The problem are not tests themselves, it is that the current education systems uses them in an incorrect way, this is as the end and not the means... and as a tool of reward and punishment, which totally misses the point why they are useful in the first place.  

Some benefits of testing that we tend to overlook are: 

- After a test, students spend more time restudying the material they missed, and they learn more from it than do their peers who restudy the material without having been tested.
- Testing doesn't need to be initiated by the instructor.
- Students who take practice tests have a better grasp of their progress than those who simply reread the material.
- Giving students corrective feedback after tests keeps them from incorrectly retaining material they have misunderstood and produces better learning of the correct answers.
- Students in classes that incorporate low-stakes quizzing come to embrace the practice.

I think that the last one is a great tool, it allows us to have the actual benefits of testing while erasing what makes students care more about grades than about learning (and understandably, from my point of view, I have also been there and in the end it is quite sad). 

The author presents retrieval in contrast to cramming (massed studying) and mentions a key difference in their outcomes: the retention that results from cramming is short-term but the one from retrieval is long-term. il

Testing is not the only way of retrieval. Practice is another one but it needs to be mindful, it cannot be just mindless repetition.

One thing that I found quite amusing is how the author frames reflection as a form of retrieval practice: *"reflection can involve several cognitive activities that lead to stronger learning: retrieving knowledge and earlier training from memory, connecting these to new experiences, and visualizing and mentally rehearsing what you might do differently next time."* I do like reflecting because it always makes me construct meaning from my past experiences so it feels good, it is motivating, it helps me make choices. This new information motivates me to take my reflection processes more seriously... how? documenting them more carefully, taking the time to write them down and not just mindlessly throwing them on twitter or insta stories (which is not necessarily bad but it does not work that well if I want to make the most of these reflections).  

The next part talks about the benefits of interleaving the practice and learning of two different subjects or skills, in contrast with the myth that sees learning only one thing with a single-minded purpose as the most effective path.

Compared to massed practice, a significant advantage of interleaving and variation is that they help us learn better how to assess context and discriminate between problems, selecting and applying the correct solution from a range of possibilities. It improves our ability to transfer learning from one situation and apply it successfully to another. It makes us develop a broader understanding of the relationships between different conditions and the movements required to succeed in them.

Varied practice is like the opposite of what the author calls 'the familiarity trap': the feeling that you know something and no longer need to practice it.

The next part of this book is about the importance of embracing difficulties. We already saw an example of this with testing. It is important to remember that when we struggle with solving the problem before being shown how to solve it, the subsequent solution is better learned and more durably remembered. I can relate to this a lot: I always payed more attention to solutions that were presented after I had made some effort to find them... and it was not deliberate, it just happened that way so probably it is just because I have a human mind and human minds work in this way. 

Something that I think I should keep very present is that fear of failure can poison learning by creating aversions to the kinds of experimentation and risk taking that characterize striving, or by diminishing performance under pressure, as in a test setting. I have to keep working on my own fear of failure, so far the only thing that I think I can concretely do is to trying techniques to detach myself emotionally (at least to a certain extent) from my fears so they don't dominate my choices and my actions. I will also remind myself of what the author wrote: *"don’t assume that you’re doing something wrong if the learning feels hard"*.

Another interesting point that is made in this chapter is the importance of retrieval cues that allow us to retrieve knowledge when we need it. We are able to develop more effective cues if the knowledge, skills and experience that we acquire hold significance, practical importance and/or keen emotional weight  and are connected with other knowledge.

The author then goes on to write about illusions of knowledge. They have already been mentioned throughout the book but here they are explained with more detail with regards to the available evidence. The author advices to use any tool that is mentioned in the book in order to make sure your judgment of what you know and can do is accurate, and that your strategies are moving you toward your goals.

Here, I think that it is relevant to mention how cramming is significantly involved in illusions of knowledge, at least at school. We study "hard" a couple of days before the text, learn enough things to pass it and repeat until the semester is over and we passed the class but can't really remember much of it. But we passed so that's what counts and it makes us believe that that's enough and that the knowledge must be in our heads, somewhere.

The book can seem repetitive at times but that is also good, since the author is taking advantage of some of the techniques that are described: by presenting them in different contexts, it is a way of applying some sort of varied practice so the main advices and techniques that are proposed are quite clear at the end.
