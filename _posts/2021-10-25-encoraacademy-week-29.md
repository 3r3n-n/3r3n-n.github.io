title: "Encora Academy Week #29"
---

This week has been quite unique in the sense that I continuously felt like I was failing. I got rejected from a process for a position after submitting a task but did not get feedback about it yet, so that lead to me trying to guess what I did wrong and I just kept overthinking for a while in an unhealthy way. 

I also switched my learning to devOps. According to AWS, DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

I have been basing my study process on this roadmap and this repo with some concepts. As they are kind of heavy to me, I search for videos about them when I want to understand them better.
