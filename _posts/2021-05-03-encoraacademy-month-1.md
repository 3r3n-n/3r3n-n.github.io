title: "TMIL (This Month I Learned...) #1"
---
A month has already passed since we began this adventure. I feel like it has been way longer but at the same time, I feel like it has passed so quickly.

The first month of Encora Academy is called the 'reset phase'. If I were to quickly define it, I would say that it is about un-learning habits that don't serve us  (as well as start adopting the ones that are actually helpful) if our goal is becoming software developers. 

Considering that, it makes sense that one of our tasks was taking the ***Learning how to Learn*** course. The first thoughts that I had when I started watching the lectures was some regret about not having known about this when I started college because I could clearly see all the bad learning habits that I maintained there, like a continuous vicious cycle. I spent many semesters trying to fit as much as I could into my schedule so I didn't give my mind the time to properly be in the diffuse mode that allows for making creative connections between ideas, for example. And let's not talk about mindlessly scrolling social media in order to not-confront anxious feelings. I made a meme-like cheatsheet for DOs and DON'T's regarding learning strategies that were presented in the course:

This course touched some concepts and ideas that were also present in the *Make it Stick* book: spaced and interleaved practice, choosing challenges (purposeful practice) and actively avoiding illusions of learning by testing oneself, for example. That's a good thing even if it felt repetitive at times, because it helped me to revisit the concepts from different approaches (the course has a more medical-neuroscientific focus, I think) and that is one of the strategies that help to retain knowledge. I will use the meme-cheatsheet as a quick reminder of the new habits that I want and need to develop. I have been exercising regularly for the last year but whenever I find myself busy, I stop doing it to have 'more time'. Now, thanks to the course, I know that exercising actually helps intelectual work so I have been trying to do workouts even on the days that are quite packed. 

Another key aspect that is related to learning is being aware of one's own skill level. It is not a trivial thing, as illusions of learning can misguide us, hence the importance of continuously testing ourselves to assess what we know and what we don't (at least not yet). Here, the Dreyfus model that we saw also this month is very useful because we might have different learning needs according to our skill level so our strategies might vary according to this. I think that, at least for IT-related things, I am certainly a novice, on my way to becoming a solid advanced-beginner. 

Something that I think is a good complement of this skill-awareness exercise is [Allison Hill's framework](https://youtu.be/757eAoMAAZ8) for [learning stages and appropriate documentation](https://alison.netlify.app/latinr-learn/#38). The first two stages are UNconscious incompetence and conscious incompetence. Unconscious incompetence is when you are so novice that you are not even aware of what you don't know (hope that makes sense)... conscious incompetence is when you become aware of it and can say 'ok, I don't know X, I must learn it'. Allison Hill says that a good tool to pass from unconscious to conscious incompetence are orientations, defined as *"a general overview that makes people aware something exists"* by Greg Wilson. I think that the beginning of my mentorship has been something like that: my mentors have told me about some key concepts and tools to start checking out... I didn't even know that I needed to know that so there you go, from unconscious to conscious competence. Passing from conscious incompetence to competence involves creating mental models and this is where tutorials and worked examples are helpful. 

A key aspect of being a novice is asking for help (and knowing how and when to do it), which has been a significative challenge for me during this month. I wrote more about this in a previous post. This past week I made the effort to just ask my peers and my mentors and I feel that it is making a difference, it even made me less anxious and I could work more efficiently (I'm still not as efficient as I think I should but I'm getting closer). As Allison Hill says, "there is no trophy for doing it the hard way". I must keep working on this for it to become a habit.

This was not only an individual process but also a collective one. As a team, we the academies struggled with teamwork on the second week so we did not achieve our weekly goal. This was like a wake-up call for us so we started being more expressive to each other about our doubts, needs, etc. So my improvement in communication and asking-for-help has also happened within this context. Now I feel like we have each other's back and that will be important for the following months. 

The pair programming sessions have also been quite relevant in my journey so far. I have found them to be tremendously helpful to solve doubts and to facilitate asking very specific questions. Looking at my peers' code has helped me to see different approaches to a solution and it has given me a broader perspective of how I can write better code. 

We have also been required to do lightning talks (almost) each week. This experience has certainly helped me to improve my public speaking skills. Some challenges that I have encountered are: 

a) The audience: this time it is different from what I was used to (my peers at school and my students when I worked as a private tutor) because now they were developers and people who have a strong foundation of CS so that felt kind of intimidating at first but I think that I found the way to present something that was kind of engaging.

b) The time constraints: when I am excited to talk about something, I want to explain myself as much as I can but here time is quite limited so I had to find ways to make my explanations more efficient. Things that helped: visual aids on slides and taking the time to practice so that I could find better ways to re-phrase my explanations and remove phrases that were not necessary.

At this point, it is probably evident that this has been as much a psychological challenge as a technical one. It has been an emotional rollercoaster since day 1. A huge part of resetting my expectations has been letting go of some things, that is part of making choices. This last week has been somewhat difficult since I have felt sad due to a collective project/initiative that I have been involved in its creation and consolidation for a couple of years now, but decided to quit (at least temporarily) to focus on the Academy. This is a decision that I had already made but these last days have been critical for that project and I felt quite sad for not being able to help my fellas. I poured my heart into the project for quite some time trying to keep it afloat so it has not been that easy to get emotionally detached from it so quickly. However, I try to remind myself that feeling that way is normal and accepting those feelings is the first step to process them and eventually they will go away when it is time. I also must remember that "negative" emotions are part of a meaningful growth and learning process so I should [be ready to accept them and learn from them](https://www.facebook.com/susandavidphd/posts/313718106786882). 

Dealing with anxious feelings and thoughts has been another challenge for me during these weeks. This is not new for me but I certainly need to take better care of it and be more proactive to explore and find techniques that work. The technique that I have been trying to apply (and expect to gradually get better at) is re-phrasing the way that I name my emotions in order to create what Susan David calls 'creating critical space between you and the emotion' so that I stay in control somewhat and don't become dominated by the emotion. I could also use some self-compassion because comparing myself with others is certainly not helping, at the end of the day the only person that I should expect to beat is myself.

So, given all of the above, some particular goals that I would like to achieve (apart from what we will be required to do) during the following weeks are:

- Dedicating at least a few minutes every day for journaling about what I have learned, how I feel and making my to-do list for the next day.
- Keeping asking for help and taking some time to think if there is a more effective way to articulate my questions and doubts.
- Breathing deeply at least a couple of times a day, exercising every day and going to bed on time.
- Revisiting my notes from previous weeks to see what has changed.
- Talking to more new people and mindfully making time for it in my schedule.
