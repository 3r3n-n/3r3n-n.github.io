title: "Encora Academy Month #4"
--- 
This month was the fourth phase of Encora Academy / Apprenticeship program: *Your Personal Brand*.

The main goal of this phase is preparing for IT job interviews. 

The skills that are needed to succeed in an interview are not only technical but also behavioral. Time is an important constraint in this activity so we want to give as much evidence as possible to our interviewer to show that we are a great fit for the respective position.

Another relevant aspect is more psychological. It is normal to feel some degree of stress with regards to the interview (and actually the whole job hunting/application) process. There are some ideas that can help us to handle this:

Kenny Werner coined the idea of [effortless mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyPdDhIEZUE) based on his musical career but it can be applied to other areas of life that involve developing a skill. You need to go of the control of the results. It is also necessary to redefine success: success is when you try regardless of the result. Failure is when you don't try. In this way you focus on your current performance regardless of its assessment.

[Timothy Gallwey](https://www.nateliason.com/notes/inner-game-of-tennis-w-timothy-gallwey) in *The Inner Game of Tennis* has a similar perspective. They talk about how we need to un-learn what we have been taught (and internalized) by society: that we are only worthy of respect if we succeed. We become sort of addicted to constantly feed our ego by any success so we get used to act in order to please other people. Unlearning this helps us to see what we are doing in a non-jugdmental way, which help us focus better on what we do and facilitates improvement and getting into flow state. This does not mean ignoring errors, just seeing events as they are. There will be time to address what is needed and learn from errors.

[Joko Willing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0NJHN8ZclE) also mentions learning to deal with stress as one of his 10 rules for success. A good relating technique is the [4-7-8 breathing exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz4G31LGyog). I have tried it and want to build it as a habit, I am still trying to find the way to incorporate it effectively into my routine.

I can relate to a lot of this. Something that I have been working on in the last years (and still have a long way to go) is to stop judging myself (and therefore, what I do) and have more self-compassion. I have noticed that the more compassionate I am to myself, the more I take the steps to ask for help, ask questions, try something new/scary and all these scenarios are the ones that have allowed me to grow. Yes, I might make mistakes but I can learn from them and some of the successes will actually happen thanks to previous mistakes. It is an iterative process, somehow. A resource that I have mentioned before but I will reiterate it anyways is Susan David's emotional agility book. I am happy that many of the ideas that she proposes resonate with this phase's learning resources, it motivates me to realize that it is part of a similar/same journey that I am going through.

Practice is key to mastering something and being non-judgmental certainly helps to keep practice consistent. In this way, we won't avoid practice due to fear of 'failure' and we will be able to improve.

This phase has also allowed me to take a retrospective approach to my learning journey. I read some texts about clean code and have been going through some scripts that I have written in the past year. While it has been somewhat cringe-worthy (why did I copy-paste my custom functions instead of putting them in a separate file and importing them ?), that is a signal that I have grown skill-wise and now I am able to improve on what I have written. I have found examples of bad practices and how I can correct them.

I have also began to work on optimizing my code. For some time I had thought of optimization as some obscure high level skill that is only allowed to CS-degree people. However, with help of the learning resources of this phase, I was able to see that the first steps for optimization are actually quite simple, the effort lies more in understanding the problem as fully as possible. And, as usual, it takes practice.

I have been practicing coding exercises in JavaScript since I chose it as my primary stack. I feel more comfortable with the language now (although I still have a long way to go) in comparison with how I was feeling a couple of months ago. I noticed the difference in my last mock interview, it was quite rewarding.

Following on the retrospective aspect of this phase, it has also allowed me to reflect on my past experiences since it is necessary to talk about them during interviews... and there is a time limit so we must be concise and taking time to remember them and trying to articulate them beforehand certainly helps. It is good since it has also helped me to build my confidence in what I have done.
