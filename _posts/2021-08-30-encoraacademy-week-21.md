title: "Encora Academy Week #21"
--- 

This week has been somewhat chaotic for me. The previous week I had forced myself to work too much on school-related stuff at night and in the early morning (before and after my Academy/Apprenticeship hours) since I was too stubborn and impatient to meet a personal deadline last Monday. This made me accumulate exhaustion and not prepare properly for this week so during these days I felt consistently tired and not productive enough.

So the very first lesson of this week was that last week's routine did not work and is not healthy. I must work on being patient with my processes because the root cause of that mess was being impatient due to comparing myself to other people and their own academic processes.

So back to what concerns this blog, this week I did some more vanilla HTML-CSS exercises and learned about z-index and relative/absolute/fixed positioning in CSS. Z-index only works with elements at the same level so they must share the same parent (they must be sibling elements). 

At the middle of the week I had a mock interview as part of getting ready for interviews with actual clients. I was more scared of the technical questions but in the end what happened was that I struggled much more with the behavioral questions. I got a ton of useful feedback about this so it was good but I felt quite overwhelmed after that, like I need to do much more work than I thought with regards to that aspect of the interview. Thankfully I got to talk to one of our staff members who was quite helpful in helping me realize how I can approach my answers and that helped me feel less anxious about it and more clear about what I need to do.

I also started learning EmberJS, an open-sourced, free JavaScript front-end framework. It makes extensive use of handlebars, which are like a <code>{{, some contents, followed by a }}</code>. When the template is executed, these expressions are replaced with values from an input object. The project structure of files in this framework is quite different to, for example, React. I have been noticing the difference in syntax. For example, if you want to iterate through an array myArray of data with the same format in order to display it inside an HTML list item, in React you would do something like:

 </p>

Whereas in EmberJS, you would write:

I also tried to deploy a very small EmberJS page to Netlify but the redirects did not work, I still need to check what is happening.

Furthermore, we started to work in teams for a week-long React project so I went back to the codebase of phase 2's project to remember how to make a router and incorporate Material-UI. I feel excited because I miss the teamwork from that phase and now I feel more familiar with the technologies.
