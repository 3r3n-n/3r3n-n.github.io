This was the first week of the second phase of Encora Academy: Building something from scratch. 

We all were assigned on a team project. Since we got to know our projects on the same day that we would meet our clients for the first time, we started chatting within our team as soon as we knew about our project. 

Some of the required material for this month includes some introduction to agile practices, so I tried to watch most of them the day before our project kick off. So far, we have been doing daily standups and trying to implement story cards; the latter has been a bit of a struggle since we were too quick to try to define them, even before defining the scope of our project so that's a lesson we learned this week: the scope is the first important step and it is crucial to have succesful communication with the client in order to appropriately define it.

Furthermore, we have been implementing something similar to the MoSCoW method to prioritize the functionalities of our project. 

The greatest challenge of this week has been (I would like to say that it was but we are still not done with this part) the project definition, since the situation is a bit complex and we need to reach a sweet spot were we provide value to the client and at the same time it is something reasonable to achieve within one month (and the clock is ticking!) so reaching an adequate definition is our highest priority right now.

My teammates have been quite clever when it comes to abstract the problem to solve, they have made really useful questions when we have got to meet the client and this has helped tremendously. As usual, I am learning a lot from them. 

I am also a bit worried about my not-so-great technical background when the time to write code comes, so during the weekend I spent some time revising the basics of Java and necessary Javascript concepts for React... since on week 5 I jumped straight into tutorials without being sure about the basics so I wanted to correct that for this phase. I am still nervous about this aspect but I will be in continuous communication with my teammates to make sure that I am understanding what we are doing, what I need to know and to ask for help as soon as something starts taking longer than planned. As usual, I am simultaneously scared and excited.. and the good thing is that I am not alone c:
