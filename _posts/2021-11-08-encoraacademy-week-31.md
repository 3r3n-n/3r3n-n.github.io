title: "Encora Academy Week #31"

This week I got fully into studying devOps concepts.

At first I was just studying about bash and doing some very basic exercises to learn the basic control flow of the language (conditionals, for loops, switch-case, etc).

We got a task that involved setting up an instance in AWS using Terraform with a subnet and a security group. 

At first I started reading about Terraform since I had not used it before. After I got a bit familiar with its main purpose I started searching for tutorials but I did not exactly know how to make all the required elements come together but fortunately my friend G helped me figure it out and we had a pair programming session. He recommended a tutorial that covered all the necessary steps and now I had enough conteext to follow it so I did that. He also helped me at the end with a couple of errors that I was getting. He also recommended a course about networking concepts, which I am currently taking and I hope that it provides me with some of the basic terms that I need to articulate concrete questions and keep learning.
