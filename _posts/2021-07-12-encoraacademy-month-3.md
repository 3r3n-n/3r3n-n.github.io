The third phase of the Encora Academy/Apprenticeship has come to an end.

I really enjoyed this phase. The beginning was really exciting and scary at the same time. I felt so enthusiastic while searching for projects to collaborate in, there are so many cool things that people are doing out there! At the same time, I was getting anxious about deciding on my stacks but my mentors helped me a lot by providing context so I could make an informed decision. 

I noticed that setting up a development environment is not trivial and can take considerable time and energy, so one must plan accordingly.

In the JavaScript project where I collaborated I had the opportunity to keep practicing React and got some familiarity with TypeScript. 

I also have to admit that I missed my teammates from the previous phase :'0 having something to share everyday was nice. I am also grateful for my teammates because the familiarity that I got with git and writing pull requests in that previous phase helped me tremendously during this month.

I also enjoyed being able to collaborate in geemap because it is a project that I had known about for a while and was quite interested in. 

I learned that contributions can imply so many different things. For example, in the JavaScript project the challenge for me was about getting more knowledge about the frameworks and technologies to be able to solve the issue. In the Python project I felt like I had more technical background (compared to JavaScript) but it was still challenging to reset my brain with assumptions from similar libraries for example, as well as reproducing a behavior from a non-open-sourced technology... this was really cool because I even had to refresh my knowledge of logarithms and some more math to provide a solution, which I was not expecting at the beginning. I also had to make observations in a systematic way to try to infer a pattern that I could represent in code. It was quite rewarding to see that my reasoning behind my solution was accepted by the project owner because I self-doubt so often of my technical reasoning so it was kind of self-reassuring.

After writing this I am becoming aware of the importance of making some time to just sit down and understand the codebase of a project before writing whatever ticket we need to address. Well, maybe not the whole codebase but what is relevant to our task (at least). The exercises of the first weeks helped me to understand this, as well as noticing my knowledge gaps of the respective technologies that I was not aware of.

I feel really fortunate to have been able to go through this phase. It has been so much fun.
