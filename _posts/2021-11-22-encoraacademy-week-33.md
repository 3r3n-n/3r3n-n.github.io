This week was more about practical linux commands and docker.

We were assigned some exercises to complete by today. The deliverables were some scripts to install certain programs on different linux distributions. Some concepts that I had been reading about came quite handy when working on these exercises.

For example, the Linux distribution families. There are three main families in Linux: Red Hat (RHEL), SUSE and Debian. Each family uses certain package managers. The RHEL family uses yum, whereas Ubuntu (in the Debian family) uses apt. So an script for installing a program must take into account the distribution of the OS that is running in the host where the program will be installed, because the package manager that will be used for the installation depends on it.

From there, it was time to use some linux commands. In a couple of cases I got to use the pipe for  automatically answering the prompt. I also learned to apply conditional blocks to, for example, install a program based on wether or not it is already installed. 

Another important thing that happened this week is that I had a mock interview and I got a ton of useful feedback on important linux commands that I missed, as well as some networking concepts that I need to study more about. It has been immensely helpful since now I know where to focus my study.
