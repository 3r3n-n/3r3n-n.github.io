title: "Encora Academy Week #1"

These are the things I learned last week. 
I wanted to try a more visual way of documenting the learning content so I tried [Canva](https://www.canva.com).
The down side is that it took me way longer than I expected (I did 1 info per text/video, maybe that was the not-so-good-idea) but it looks nice, I think.

Considering this with regards to my own life, I think about my goal of mastering the [Google Earth Engine API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/api_docs). 

For this, I think that a practical approach that incorporates purposeful practice would be learning one (preferably two) Earth Engine function or method every day.
This would involve at the end either writing a code chunk with an specific purpose; or updating an existing piece of code that I had written before with the respective new function/method (it this leads to an improvement in the code). 
I would spend an hour doing this, although I don’t know if it is too little time… but there is only one way to find out c:

Something I recently noticed that relates to this, is that I ask very lame questions when I am getting to know someone, the typical ‘what do you do?’, ‘what did you study?’, ‘what is your thesis about?’. What is even more embarrasing is, I am also not very excited when it is other people who ask me these same questions. This probably relates to my autopilot problem I think, I often don’t pay enough attention to my interpersonal interactions because my mind is just busy worrying and having anxiety about something. So if I don’t pay attention, I don’t have personalized and specific inquiries to make and I resort to these boring questions. I feel so embarrassed now LOL. I must work on this.
