title: "Encora Academy Week #16"
--- 

This was the second week of the fourth phase of Encora Academy/Apprenticeship: your personal brand.

As part of this phase, we have to get as familiar as possible with interviews so one of the activities is planning and doing a mock interview with one of our fellow academies. 

So I started this week by drafting an interview rubric for the mock interview that I would be delivering. For this to work, I was also supposed to know the answers to the questions that I should ask, so this implied that I should study these concepts. I had already read about them but I needed to review these topics. 

The interview went fine, at least in my perspective. I felt good that my interviewee found my feedback useful, that was quite rewarding. I also learned a lot from him, like how to articulate responses to certain questions to make your point clear.

Besides that, I also did some more coding exercises and I am quite glad I have been doing that since it has helped me to review topics too, like map / filter / foreach in JS, for example. So they are helpful in that sense too, they are a starting point for studying concepts and seeing them directly applied in the implementation, which is always pretty cool.

I think that the most significant insight that I got this week was regarding clean code. I was reading some texts about it and I immediately thought of some pieces of code that I have written in the last year, mainly in a self-taught context. I remember my code getting way too long and messy even for me to understand it one day after I had written it and thinking that surely there was a better way to write this but not knowing how to approach that or even the key words to search for some concrete guidelines. Some of that code is in personal projects that are currently on stand-by but some other is part of my thesis for uni so I thought that it was a worthy exercise to look at it in retrospective and try to refactor some of it, at least from the files that I am currently using. I mainly focused on modularizing it and moving functions to a file. I also renamed variables and functions so it was easier to understand their purpose. The next steps I took were related to splitting the functions so they only do one thing. After I did this, I immediately noticed the difference in one of the files, now it was much easier to keep track of what was happening. That was quite rewarding and motivating to keep improving with regards to best practices.
