This week I kept working on my knowledge of HTML and CSS fundamentals.

I learned about basic applied accessibility and responsive web design principles. I did an exercise that was about implementing a layout, provided the style guide and the mockups.

It took me a while to do it, I hope that it is because I am a beginner and soon I can catch up with some more speed. I struggled a bit with making the layout responsive so I read some more resources about this. I noticed that I was misunderstanding how to apply media queries in CSS so I corrected that. My main challenge was figuring out how to keep the proportions of the component when using a narrow mobile-like window (so this would be the content of the media query). As I had chosen to base the size of the elements on the size of the body font (with `em` units), I noticed that the proportions would be constant independently of the font size used in the body so I made the body `font-size` to be proportional to the window width using `vw` units. It made really happy that I did not need to change a lot in my code to incorporate responsiveness.

I got useful feedback from my mentor in a code review so it has also helped me to be more mindful of best practices with these technologies.

I have also been working on how to articulate a personal pitch and talk about myself. It has been challenging to clearly talk about my strengths and weaknesses, also because I tend to over-explain myself, so it is some of the things that I need to keep working on.
