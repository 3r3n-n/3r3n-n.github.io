During this last week of Encora Academy/Apprenticeship I have been learning some core concepts of JavaScript and React that are new for me.

As a high-level language, JS needs to be 'translated' into bytecode and then machine-level code to be executed. This is achieved through a execution engine. The most common one nowadays is V8. 

This engine uses a call stack and a memory heap to store and keep track of the necessary data to run the respective code so it is erased by the garbage collector when it is not used (referenced) anymore. It also uses the event loop to handle asynchronous tasks that are sent to the web APIs in a browser context.

I also learned some of the fundamental concepts for React. This library makes extensive use of the JSX syntax extension, which stands for JavaScript XML. It is like a template language where you write JS code coupled with HTML tags to build your components.

React uses a virtual DOM as an internal representation of the DOM. With each update, React compares its virtual DOM with the actual DOM and only re-paint what it finds to have changed (the diffs, let's say). This is good because it does not need to re-render the whole page.

I have also kept practicing HTML and CSS. I got to a point where I noticed that it would be better to use react or whatever framework that allows to re-use elements so the code is cleaner and more maintainable. I am curious about learning SASS to see if it helps but probably I might prioritize consolidating my React skills and maybe learning a new JS framework. 

I am again in that place where I want to learn a lot of things but time is limited and I need to take some time to think more clearly and prioritize.
