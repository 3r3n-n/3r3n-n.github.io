title: "Encora Academy Week #18"
--- 
This was the last week of the fourth phase of Encora Academy/Apprenticeship: your personal brand.

My main focus during this week was catching up with basic front end concepts. From previous mock interviews and experience I knew that I had significant gaps in my front end knowledge so it was time to begin addressing this.

So I did the first modules of the freecodecamp responsive web design certification (hopefully I can finish the other topics this next week). My main weakness so far had been CSS (I actually identified some bad practices that I was doing previously like styling inline) so I paid special attention to that module. I became more familiar with the structure of CSS, the rulesets and how we can write them according to classes, specific HTML tags, element IDs, pseudo-classes, etc.

I also began doing some coding problems that were a bit harder. I struggled a lot because now my solution does not only need to address the problem but also has to meet a minimum degree of being optimal. So this week I also had some hands-on learning regarding optimization. Last week was mostly about reducing the amount of (nested) loops. This time was about skipping cases that by definition would not help us get to our goal. I realized that I was not finding a more optimal solution because I was not trying to see the problem from different perspectives. This means sometimes just the way we phrase it. I was also focusing too much on the examples that were given. If I had used my imagination more, my understanding would reach more abstraction and it would make it more probable for me to come up with a more generalizable solution (which was necessary since it needed to work on larger amounts of data).

I also had a mock (coding) interview but this time I was the interviewee. I realized that I can fairly think out loud and clearly explain my reasoning... as long as I am not too stressed / nervous. But it is an interview so chances of getting nervous are high so I have to work on overcoming that. I got nervous when I started to struggle understanding why my solution was not working. I think it has to do with embarrassment as well. I just know that the way to get better at this is practicing more in order to get more comfortable (or less uncomfortable, at least).
