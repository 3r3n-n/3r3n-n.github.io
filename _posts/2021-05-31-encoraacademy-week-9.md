title: "Encora Academy Week #9"
---
I donÂ´t really know how to begin to describe this week. It has been full of diverse situations... I don't know it I should be using the term black swan because it is more related to catastrophes and it is not the case but they have certainly been unpredictable in some sense... or at least we failed a bit in predicting them so they became black swans. At least some of them.

Ok, now it sounds like this week was bad and it was not but it came with bigger surprises than the previous ones, I think. 

As this is an emotional rollercoaster, I was feeling quite enthusiastic at the beginning of the week since we were gaining a lot of momentum in our progress. We were done with one of the three phases of the project in a couple of days. It was in part because we worked during the weekend to adjust the project scope but also because the hardest part, the beginning, was somehow consolidated and the rest was about adding some more parts, I don't know how to explain it but it required much less technical and organizational work (we were also much more familiar with the technologies than we were one week before so this helped us to a) make more accurate estimations of how viable something was, given our time constraints and b) get the work done faster).

This feeling was also due to the continuous support of my peers and my mentors, who were always attentive to the questions I had and at that point I was much more comfortable with asking. Having some more terminology certainly helped me to better formulate my questions, I need to keep studying concepts in order to get better at this.

Furthermore, I got excited because I was able to write some functions for calling the API from the frontend (the breakable toy exercise was quite helpful for me in this sense, I had a familiar reference) and being able to see the components that I made actually communicate with the backend was really rewarding.

A day later we got the news that one of our peers would not continue with the program so that made me a bit sad, it is amazing how used we all got to each other in so little time... and at least for me, having much less systems background, have learned so much from them so I really look up to them and seeing them go is like I don't know, it also hits a bit more because of that. 

Another unexpected thing (this one was certainly nice) happened just the day before our scheduled last demo. There were still quite some more to-dos in the backend than there were at the frontend and they were more urgent, I wanted to help but I had not done anything in the backend... for instance, I thought that I had lost my chance of doing some backend stuff... until that happened and I checked the tickets to see if there was one that I could do without taking way longer than someone else would. Our backend is written with Java Spring so I had the chance to get some familiarity with the project structure and how the data models are implemented. I had to make a small modification to the users data model and thus I had to update other classes that depended on this definition so it really helped me to see how they related to each other.

The day of the demo, we finally did not do it because our client was not able to attend, however this was a challenge that we also overcame, it did not stop us from working on some details that we still needed to sort out. One of them was a critical feature that was not actually a part of the client's original process but was necessary as a consequence of implementing this system and we had not dimensioned its importance. We spent the weekend building that feature and it helped me to get some more familiarity with the backend, as well as some vanilla Javascript functions that helped me to reuse components.

This week passed too quickly and I am still digesting everything that we did and everything that happened but I am glad about all that I have learned too.
