title: "Encora Academy Week #23"
---

This week was the last one of our React classes. We learned about consuming REST APIs through JS fetch and the Axios library. We also took a class on HTML and CSS where we learned about the ARIA specification and how important it is in terms of accessibility, among other things.

I read a bit more about accessibility and found [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/news/accesibilidad-web-cuales-son-los-seis-errores-mas-comunes-y-como-solucionarlos/) that talks about common mistakes, I found it quite useful since I realized that I am not including `<label>` elements in my forms so this is something that I urgently need to address in the following week.

Another big topic this week was TypeScript. It is a superset of JavaScript that adds functionality like static type-checking, interfaces and classes. The browser can't run TypeScript so it first needs to be compiled to JavaScript. 

When we write code in plain JS, its dynamic typing can help us in the beginning to write fast. However, as our codebase grows, it becomes more difficult to read and thus, maintain. This is when TypeScript is helpful. 

We have been migrating our project to TypeScript. We began with the smaller components. Something that I find really useful is that we don't need to migrate the whole project for it to be able to run, so we can gradually work on the migration. I have noticed that it forces you to think about how you are structuring your code and this can bring ideas for improvement.
