This week has been somewhat tough but it has been meaningful in the sense that I am starting to concretely see how we should be incorporating the ideas we learn in 'theory' within our coding and teamwork practice. 

I found a lot of opportune advice in Eric Lladós' [talk about giving talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0s6ZLkV-U0). He says that we usually focus on what we are doing and saying, trying not to make mistakes, but presentations go better when we focus on the audience, what might they be thinking or feeling. I feel that this is quite my case:  I have felt quite nervous about making mistakes during my two lightning talks but forget about my audience's response. I should be more mindful about it. I also have found difficulty in establishing the scope and limits of the content of my talk, trying to fit too many not-so-simple concepts in a few minutes. This talk recommends using deductive approach (first general idea, then details) for long presentations (>20 mins) and  inductive approach (details first so people can get the general idea in the end) for short presentations. I really like the point of making the audience achieve flux state, this is when your brain thinks with an appropriate level of effort (not trying to understand complex algebra, but also not the vowels), this relates to the PEAK method that involves keeping at the edge of our abilities. 

This week I experienced the consequences of not asking for help soon enough. Well, I think that I had experienced them before at school but I had not been mindful about them because #autopilot so I hadn't really given myself the opportunity to learn from them. I tend to make a lot of assumptions about why I should not be asking for help: 'this is too simple to be asking for help, I am supposed to know this', for example. [Marshall Goldsmith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WBeGAAYWg8) says that wanting winning and showing-how-smart-we-are so much are actually things that hold us back. I think that I have internalized these patterns for quite a long time, they are not even explicit in my mind but I know they are still there somehow... something about making achievements the only foundation of my identity and my value as a person. I consciously know why this is not good and I have been working on this for more than a couple of years. However, I know that, emotionally, I am still not in a place where I can say that I am over these toxic self-conception patterns, I still have a lot of work to do. Despite that, it is good that I keep encountering these opportunities to reflect on this because they remind me of the aspects that I need to keep working on, and they motivate me to keep moving forward. This is a privilege, not everyone has them. Ok, maybe that was too much vulnerability, let's move on to something else please. 

We have also been coding in Java for a movie recommender project. We were provided with [the basis for the implementation](https://github.com/apache/mahout/blob/trunk/website/users/recommender/userbased-5-minutes.md) and some code for testing, using the [mahout](https://mahout.apache.org/) framework, which focuses on linear algebra and can be applied to machine learning problems. Recommender systems are an important class of machine learning algorithms that offer "relevant" suggestions to users. According to this very informative [explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw) by Josh Gordon from Google, machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence the study of algorithms that learn from examples and experience instead of relying on hard-coded rules.

I watched a [couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZspR5PZemcs) of additional [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeg1DEeWUjA) in order to understand a bit better about the underlying principle of these recommendation algorithms, which was really stimulating. Practically, recommender systems encompass a class of techniques and algorithms which are able to suggest “relevant” items to users. There are two main methods for implementing recommenders: content-based and user-based (also called collaborative filtering). These methods differ in how they define relevancy. The implementation that we are working with belongs to the second category. This consists in finding other users with similar content-consumption patterns and finding movies that the subject-user has not seen but their fellow similar-taste users have consumed and positively reacted to (this would translate in a high review score, for example). 

Something that I found really cool was that the matrix factorization that is used as part of the implementation also work for compression purposes so it helped enormously with my understanding of this topic from the previous week. 

In addition, we covered some material on [how Java dependencies work and came to be](https://www.jrebel.com/blog/java-build-tools-for-dependency-management). This was informative with regards to the movie recommender project, since we need to import mahout into the pom.xml file. We also read this [text](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/) about version control systems, which helped me improve my GIT knowledge with regards to its conceptual basis (the snapshot concept is specially helpful, I think). I still need to incorporate it into my coding practice, though (and only in that way is that I will fully grasp it). I also got to know about VIM through this other [text](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/). VIM is a terminal-based text editor, which comes handy when coding because you only use the keyboard instead of the mouse. I had used nano (a similar terminal text editor) a few times but not even in a mindful way, I was following a tutorial for something (can't remember what I was trying to do)... so now I feel like I should be actively using VIM. 

Other common topic this week was testing. Since I am new to the software development world, this concept is totally new to me so I went into the very basics of it. According to this [text](https://www.guru99.com/software-testing-introduction-importance.html), testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements. One way of testing is [unit testing](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html); its definitions vary but they agree that they are low-level (they focus in a small part of the software system), they are written by the programmers themselves using their regular tools and they are expected to be significantly faster than other types of tests. A popular framework that intends to organize and run unit tests is [XUnit](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Xunit.html). There is even a [Test Driven](http://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment) approach to development, which takes testing as a core part of the process since the start. In this way, every step incorporates testing: coding, integrating, deploying, releasing and steering. [Mocks](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html) are other element that is relevant to testing. They are a type of testing double, which is ny kind of pretend object used in place of a real object for testing purposes. The particular feature of mockes is that they are pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive. In the movie recommended exercise, we were given a piece of code that was related to testing the class that we needed to implement. I don't know if this can be called unit testing, since I still struggle with how to define a unit. I think that there are two units in this problem: one that relates to re-arranging the input data into a CSV and other that relates to the actual recommender implementation. But I am not sure. 

Another broad topic that we saw this week relates to quantum science and technology. The double slit experiment was mentioned and described through [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKdoE1vX7k4) of the talks because it is a demonstration that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles; moreover, it displays the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical phenomena. 

There is a fundamental scientific 'controversy' in the quantum mechanics field: measuring the position of an electron implies that we find it at a single location but this is not what happens... there are more than one location. How do we navigate from the place of probability to the place of definite reality ? There are four proposed resolutions to the measurement problem: De Broglie-Bohm, many worlds, spontaneous collapse and Qbism. I am not going to describe them here because I don't fully understand them anyway so just keep in mind that they exist and there does not seem to be a full consensus on which one is 'the one'. If you want to know more about them, you can watch this panel with David Albert (philosopher), Sheldon Goldstein (mathematician), Sean Carroll (theoretical physicist) and Rediger Schack (mathematician) at [World Science Festival 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdqC2bVLesQ).

The weirdest thing to me about quantum mechanics is that it actually predicts a comprehensible universe but at the cost of forcing you to believe that what you perceive as physical reality is not actually real, it’s actually an illusion, according to Ron Garret's [talk at Google TechTalks 2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc).

So at this point things get kind of existential and the Carl Sagan's [pale blue dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO5FwsblpT8) iconic narration makes a lot of sense because our existence just seems so meaningless within the inmenseness and weirdness of the universe but at the same time it makes our planet seem so unique and valuable (not in a monetary sense, though).

In addition to this, something really cool about our planet's place apparent uniqueness in the universe is that the [Google and NASA's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMdHDHEuOUE) is actually exploring the potential of quantum computing—and quantum annealing algorithms in particular—to aid in the many challenging computational problems involved in NASA missions... one of them actually involves the NASA Kepler mission’s search for habitable, Earth-sized planets. The complex computational task of identifying and validating the transit signals of smaller planets as they orbit their host stars is currently based on heuristic algorithms (designed to find approximate solutions when classic methods don’t find exact solutions), implying that some planets could remain undiscovered due to this computational limitation. This is not exactly what the assessment video says, it is at the [NASA](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/quail/research/) website (I got curious about it). 

Quantum computers work with qubits, which can be any 2-level quantum system (fotons, electrons spin in magnetic field or their polarization). Qubits can also be set to 0 or 1... but in quantum mechanics, systems can be in both states at once (superposition) because it is a matter of probability. However, as soon as you make an observation (measurement), it takes a single value (remember the measurement problem). Quantum computers are specially suitable for database search, dodging cybersecurity and quantum simulation (molecules behavior, etc)., according to Kurzgesagt's animated [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28).

Another cool lab is [Google X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oKmb7U3H6U) , whose goal is to find great problems that affect billions of people and come up with some real breakthrough solution that's at least ten times better than anything that anybody's tried yet. They have a process that they call rapid evaluation so for example when someone comes up with a great idea, in a couple of days they run some experiments that give them an idea about how feasible is that.

The working principle of this lab is 10X thinking (or moonshot thinking), [explained by Astro Teller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA_8IO3vbFs): It’s easier to make something 10x better than 10% better. Failing fast , valuing try and learning for mistakes are essential elements of this work philosophy. It is necessary to create opportunities for people who take these big risks in order to allow moonshot thinking to be put into practice.

These are all really cool new trends in IT and science in general. As Bret Victor said at his [Dropbox's DBX conference 2013](https://vimeo.com/71278954), we currently make use of technologies even if some time ago they were thought to be almost impossible and these ideas keep coming because people don’t know what to do with programming so they feeel free to explore all possibilities.

Bret Victor talks about another interesting concept in [his other talk](https://vimeo.com/36579366) with regards to inventing on principle. This means inventing by seeing problems as a responsibility to address them, not as business opportunities. He proposes that technologists can fight by inventing in contrast to social activists who typically fight through organizing. I would argue that inventing something as a contribution to the common good is not necessarily fighting as it heavily depends on the context. I also think that the way he frames it is quite sugarcoated and the reality looks quite different when people actually go out of their way to challenge the status quo through technology (we know [what happened to Aaron Swartz](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/07/aaron-swartz-suicide-internets-own-boy), we know how [Alexandra Elbakyan](https://sci-hub.do/alexandra) has been [investigated by US authorities](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-department-investigates-sci-hub-founder-on-suspicion-of-working-for-russian-intelligence/2019/12/19/9dbcb6e6-2277-11ea-a153-dce4b94e4249_story.html)).

 There are some other reasons why I personally would take that statement with a grain of salt but if I start explaining myself, this essay would get way longer than it already is and I know that you must be tired and a bit bored of this text at this point (and I don't know how to explain myself very well). But yes, I think that this is quite an interesting point.

Besides that, Bret Victor says that inventing on principle starts by recognizing a wrong that has gone unacknowledged in the culture. It is quite amusing how he shows that there are elements in our social reality that exist and affect people without being acknowleged. This reminds me of my favorite speech of all times that means a lot to me, *[this is water* by David Foster Wallace](https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/). It revolves around the following analogy:

> There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”

He uses this story as a didactic tool to show that "the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about." And this is, I think, why there is significant value in what Bret Victor proposes as the first step of inventing on principle. It requires paying a lot of attention and avoiding assumptions (some of which are based on our own expertise background, ironically). 

Additionally, Bret Victor goes on to question the tendency to make our skills a core part of our identity. This caught my attention because at least in higher education, I feel that this is so common. There is this weight that is placed on fitting into the definitions of majors and it is somehow a problem if you feel like you don't fit and for example have a non-conventional career path... (actually we don't need to fit but feel like we do).   

But anyway, Bret Victor's point is that inventing on principle requires defining oneself by a cause instead of a craft. And this is where things get even more interesting because finding one's cause is a journey of its own. As he says, finding a principle is a form of self-discovery. He says that, in order to achieve this, it is necessary to build a corpus of experiences that you feel strongly about for some reason and try to make sense of it. This means trying a lot of different things and paying attention to what speaks to you, because principles are more specific than abstract so it is not enough to just say 'world peace', for example. He says something that I think is a good guideline when something really gets to you: "you can choose to accept the world as it is but you don't have to". So I think that this point is the same as Susan David's concept of walking your why, she defines it as 'the art of living by your own personal set of values'. She wrote [a really cool psychology book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209485-emotional-agility) that explains it in depth and I feel really grateful that I found and read it last year because it helped me to get through the pandemic and it has given me a lot of tools (I am still working on implementing them all but at least now I know about them). 

I don't know how to finish this too-long essay but I will just say that lots of things have been 'clicking' lately and this last talk was a very nice opportunity to make sense of them but there is no definite conclusion here, it just feels so good that some things are finally making sense. I feel like I just want to copypaste the whole this-is-water speech here.
