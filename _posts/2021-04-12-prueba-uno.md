title: "Encora Academy Week #1"

These are the things I learned last week. 
I wanted to try a more visual way of documenting the learning content so I tried [Canva](https://www.canva.com).
The down side is that it took me way longer than I expected (I did 1 info per text/video, maybe that was the not-so-good-idea) but it looks nice, I think.

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:
