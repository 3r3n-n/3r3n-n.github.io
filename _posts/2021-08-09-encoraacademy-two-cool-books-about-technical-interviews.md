title: â€œTwo cool books about technical interviews"
--- 

The fourth phase of Encora Academy/Apprenticeship is called *Your Personal Brand*. This phase is about getting ready for interviews, which is not a trivial thing at all. As part of this, we read two main books: *Cracking the Code Interview* (CCI) by Gayle Laakman McDowell and *Elements of Programming Interviews* (EPI) by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee and Amit Prakash. The second book has different volumes based on an specific programming language. I chose to read the volume that is based on Python since it is my secondary stack.

I want to begin by mentioning that, besides all the concrete pieces of useful content that these book provide, they are also helpful in the sense that they make the idea of interviews a little less scary since they give you an idea of what to expect. At least to me this is quite valuable since the uncertainty of not knowing at all how it is going to be makes me quite scared and feeling that way certainly impacts how I can perform.

The CCI book is quite good in contextualizing how the interview format can vary depending on the type of company. This allows us to prepare more specifically according to the type of companies that we will be interviewing for. 

The EPI book provides a clever description of the interviewer's perspective. Although this may sound counterintuitive, it is actually quite useful since it helps us to structure our response approach in order to, let's say, make it easier for the interviewer to see our strengths that give us more points.

Something that I also liked about EPI is that it gets very specific and concrete with regards to behavior and soft-skills / cultural-fit related considerations. Sometimes it is hard to realize these things so I am glad that the authors took the time to put this into words.

A key aspect that defines how we approach interviews succesfully is the time constraint. This is relevant in the behavioral questions too. We don't have much time to remember our hardest professional challenge and provide enough context to effectively communicate the punchline of how that makes us a good/better candidate that can provide value. I think that the CCI book is quite helpful in this aspect, since it provides key questions for reflecting on our previous experiences so we can prepare our answers: not only the WHAT but also the way we articulate them.

These books are also tremendously helpful in the technical aspect. The first myth that they debunk is that the interviewer only cares about whether or not we were able to finish coding the solution. What do they care about, then ? Well, for example, they look for clean code, ability to communicate a somewhat complex idea, ability to optimize the solution, etc. It is good to know this, however, we will only be able to get better at this by practicing coding problems.

The CCI book provides useful theoretical background that can help us tackle the optimization aspect because it provides a chapter that is exclusively dedicated to big O notation. It provides the conceptual framework as well as exercises that help to apply this concept and consolidate its understanding.

I really like that both books provide practical examples with explanations about the approaches and the relevant concepts, it is not always easy to find learning material with this kind of balance.
