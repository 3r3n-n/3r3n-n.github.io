title: "Book review: Code..."

As part of the reset phase of Encora Academy, we read the book ***Code: The Hidden Language of computer Hardware and Software***, published in 1999 and written by Charles Petzold.

I see this book as an epic story of how a modern (pre-networked) computer is built, a puzzle of historical-technological achievements of human kind.

The author achieves this by introducing all the necessary elements in a very casual way, as part of daily life anecdotes. It begins with explaining morse code as one form of binary code, and, more fundamentally, as a form of language. Morse has nothing to do with building computers. However, it is a meaningful example of how codes are not necessarily related to them, but are always a form of language.

The books goes up one complexity-step with each chapter, so then the author goes on to talk abour Braille code and provides a nice example of how escape codes work (I had no idea that it also existed in Braille!): they let you “escape” from the routine interpretation of a sequence of codes and move to a new one. In this case, escaping is about going from numbers to letters. 

Then, the author moves to the foundations of computer hardware. He explains the usefulness of one of the basic components of electrical circuits: switches. At this point, the first bridge between the conceptual-numerical world and the physical world becomes apparent: electrical switches only have two possible states: open and closed... so it is like a binary system (wink, wink). Here we can also make another connection with morse code: the telegraph. We start to see how it is possible to transmit information through certain codes (languages) with the help of (still simple) electrical devices.

In addition, the author makes a parentheses to deconstruct the idea of the decimal number system, since we might think of it as a given because it is practically the only system that we consciously use in our daily lives, but we could actually be using any other numerical base... except that way long ago, our ancestors found this base handy because we usually have ten fingers in both hands. 

The next steps are about understanding how switches can be arranged and wired to perform very simple Boolean operations: for example, two switches in parallel are performing the equivalent of a Boolean OR operation. This is also the principle of logic gates, which provide the hardware basis for performing basic math operations like addition and subtraction. 

From here, we have another crucial element: memory. The author explains the physical electronical principle, as well as a key element: RAM memory is volatile because all the electromagnets that sustain the data lose their orientation as soon as the current is cut (remember that the magnitude of the magnetic field vectors depend on electrical flow, according to Maxwell's laws). 

Moreover, the author explains how it is possible to arrange data each 8-bit chunk and this allows for automation and therefore are the basis for microprocessors.

Another concept that appears at this point are alphabetical data (characters). Their meaning is not numeric, however, this data is connected to numerical references through the ASCII system. 

I see this as introducing different data types with relation to their complexity, because the author talks next about fixed point and floating point numbers. Like in school, when we learn about the different number domains and they also grow in complexity.

The above explanations help to describe low level and high level languages. The author goes on to explain operating systems and the introduction of the graphical interfaces in computers that fueled a revolution in technology. 

I found this book quite enjoyable since I think that it achieved a similar effect of amusement to geological stories of our planet's evolution, for example. In our current world, things move so fast and our lives (at least as urban somewhat-privileged people) are so embedded in the digital spaces that it is easy to forget about all the processes that needed to happen for us to have all these amazing tools. We are truly standing on the shoulders of giants.
