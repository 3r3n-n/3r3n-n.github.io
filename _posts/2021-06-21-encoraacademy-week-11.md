title: "Encora Academy Week #11"
---
This was the second week of Encora Academy's third phase: contributing to open source. 

I began the week by trying to implement my contribution for the JavaScript project where I got a positive response from the maintainer. It was about typing some files into TypeScript. Since I had already spent quite some time reading about JavaScript basics and some TypeScript introduction, I decided that I should just jump straight into the codebase and using my best friend St. Google in case that I needed to get some context, instead of waiting to read all the concepts. 

I started to get confused with some Typescript-eslint errors that I was getting so I asked my mentor for help and we spent the whole afternon trying to understand how the code was structured, after quite some hours we concluded that the project was not well-written (it has just a little more than a thousand stars), probably the reason why it was not as popular as other JS libraries with similar functionalities. Hence, it was not a good idea to keep trying to contribute there. My mentor suggested to me another JavaScript-based project that looked really cool because it is a music streamer, it was a bit late already so the next day, the first thing I did was writing to the maintainers asking to collaborate in an issue. 

At this point, I learned that, if I don't yet have enough knowledge to quickly assess if a project has at least ok-code, it is important that I get a second opinion from someone who is much more experienced. 

While I waited for a response that day, I set my environment for the python project that I want to contribute. The project uses tox and flake8 for testing so I ran the test commands after cloning the repo and installing the necessary packages. I had to install three more versions of Python3 (3.5, 3.6, 3.7) because tox checks if the code runs properly on different versions. I took a while (well... the whole day, actually hehehe) in order to be able to install multiple versions and include them into the project environment but I was able to do it at the end. I am still getting errors from the flake8 test for the original cloned repo (without any modification from my part) but it is related to style so I will contact the maintainer regarding this.

The following day I started setting my environment for the new JavaScript project since I got a positive response from the maintainers. It did not take me as long as the previous day so I got the impression that Node is friendlier than Python when it comes to development environments but I also got help from one of my mentors with Node so I may be quite biased hehe. I spent the rest of the day working on one of my research questions as part of the phase assignments.

The following day was already Friday so I studied the JavaScript project codebase to answer my second research question, which was quite helpful as I got familiar not only with the project structure but also with some electron built-in functions, the lodash library and learning new ways to pass props through different react components. 

My big mistake of this week was the first JavaScript project and adding it to last week's mistake (taking too much time to read JavaScript fundamentals), I am behind the expected progress for today so I will be focusing on my two project contributions the next days.

Here I think that it is worth mentioning that apart from my mistakes, maybe I would not be so behind had I worked during this weekend but so far I had not spent a single weekend without dedicating more than half of it to Academy-related activities and I had already been feeling emotionally and somewhat mentally exhausted for quite some weeks. I know that I donÂ´t need to justify taking designated non-work days for their intended purpose but I wanted to mention it since it is also a significant aspect of my learning journey: how to balance the self-care/health factor into this new routine and professional world and what type of decisions are usually involved. I don't have a conclusion yet, though.
