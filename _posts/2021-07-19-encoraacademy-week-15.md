title: "Encora Academy Week #15"
--- 

This was the first week of the fourth phase of Encora Academy/Apprenticeship program: your personal brand.

The goal of this phase is to polish our CV and interview skills. 

I entered this phase knowing that I have a lot to study in order to catch up with computer science concepts that are usually asked, as well as general knowledge about my stack (JavaScript and Python). By that moment I had already had some practice with them but never had taken the time to read about the more 'theoretical' stuff and how it relates to our daily coding practices and decisions, for example.

So this first week I have mainly focused on filling the most evident/urgent gaps in my knowledge of software engineering concepts as well as JavaScript and Python.

I have been reading quite some stuff on data structures and algorithms. I have noticed that each programming language has their way of implementing and naming each data structure so sometimes that can get confusing and it is a good habit to read the respective documentation to avoid assuming things just because of the names. For example, an Array object in JavaScript is not exactly what the theoretical data structures says. According to the documentation, [they are more like lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

One of the particular concepts that I have focused on is promises in JavaScript because in the last months it is something that I have repeatedly struggled with. Promises are a particular kind of object that came with ES6 and it helps us manage asynchronous actions. A promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value, so is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function. I also read about callbacks because I was still confused about them, turns out that the definition is quite simple: a callback is a function that you pass as a parameter to another function. 

I have studied more concepts and topics but these are just a couple that I wanted to mention here. I have also been reading and watching material about interviews. Some of the tips for interviews, particularly for the technical exercise part is thinking out loud and writing down your approach on paper before proceeding to writing code. I have recently noticed that sketching my approach on paper helps a lot... it helps me to figure things out and it is also helpful when writing the actual code because it works as a guide, it helps me remember what I am trying to achieve and how I am planning to achieve it. So I started practicing with coding exercises in Hackerrank and re-incorporating this habit. I also started trying to think out loud... it feels weird sometimes, specially when I am taking a bit long to come up with the next part of my idea but I will keep trying.

There are many things that worry me, specially how I am going to talk about myself in a genuine way and at the same time appear hirable if I have no academic or professional background in IT. But this is the challenge and we will see how it goes.
